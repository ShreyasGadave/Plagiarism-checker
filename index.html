              While writing your paper, you notice a familiar line. Did you read
              it somewhere? If you borrowed a few lines and didn’t cite them,
              does that count as plagiarism, even if they’re just a small part?

            <p>
              "Using someone else’s text without attribution is plagiarism,
              intentional or not. Unintentional plagiarism, even if it's just a
              sentence, can lead to serious consequences like failing grades.
              Fortunately, you can ensure your work's authenticity with
              Writerwise. This plagiarism checker helps you identify any
              unintentional use of others' words or ideas, protecting you from

            What are the different types of plagiarism?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              1. Direct Plagiarism: This involves copying someone else's work
              word-for-word without any citation. It's considered the most
              blatant form of plagiarism and can lead to severe penalties.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Self-Plagiarism: This occurs when an author reuses their own
              previously submitted work in a new context without permission or
              proper citation. It misleads readers into thinking the work is
              original.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Mosaic Plagiarism: This type involves mixing phrases or ideas
              from different sources into a new piece without proper
              attribution. Even if the wording is changed, the original sources
              must still be credited.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Paraphrasing Plagiarism: This occurs when someone rewrites
              someone else's ideas in their own words but fails to cite the
              original source. While the wording may differ, the underlying
              concept is still borrowed.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Accidental Plagiarism: This type happens when a writer
              unintentionally fails to cite sources or misquotes, leading to the
              unintentional use of another's work. Despite the lack of intent,
              it still violates academic integrity.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Understanding the different forms of plagiarism is crucial to
              preventing them. To avoid plagiarism:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Always provide proper citations for any ideas, quotes, or
              information taken from other sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Utilize plagiarism detection tools like Writerwise to check for
              unintentional plagiarism before submitting your work.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Paraphrase correctly: when restating someone else's ideas, do
              so in your own words and always cite the original source.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Keep track of your sources and maintain a bibliography or works
              cited page.

            What is the difference between plagiarism and copyright
            infringement?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Plagiarism involves using someone else’s work or ideas without
              attribution, regardless of whether the content is protected by
              copyright. It is primarily an ethical concern, often leading to
              academic consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Copyright infringement, however, is a legal issue that occurs when
              copyrighted material is used without permission from the copyright
              holder. Unlike plagiarism, copyright infringement can result in
              legal action.
